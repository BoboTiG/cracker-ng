[ july 24 2012 ]
	. Cracker-ng 2012.07-24 released
	. all modules:
		* use of char* instead of std::string (speed up process by 30%)
		* few optimizations
		+ PWD_MAX constant to define the maximum password length (as defined into official sources)
	. CPT module:
		. updated to version 0.1-2
		* functions into ccryptlib.c
	. ZIP module:
		. updated to version 0.1a-6
		* functions into crypt.cpp
		+ print Boost libraries version used with -v (or --version) option
	. shared functions:
		* functions into functions-ng.cpp
		+ read_stdin() to get line from STDIN

[ february 29 2012 ]
	. Cracker-ng 2012.02-29 released
	* reordered structs to feet the good alignment
	. added binaries for GNU/Linux (if you can manage to compile zipcracker-ng on Windows I give you a beer!)
	. CPT module:
		. updated to version 0.1-1
		* optimize functions into ccryptlib.c
	. ZIP module:
		. updated to version 0.1a-5
		^ segfault on few deflated archives into traditional_pkware()
		* several optimizations
	. shared functions:
		^ use of Sleep() on Windows for stats()

[ december 23 2011 ]
	. Cracker-ng 2011.12-23 released
	. ZIP module:
		. updated to version 0.1a-4
		^ use delete[] instead of delete for read_central_directory()
		^ memory allocation into read_central_directory() and read_local_file_header()
		^ block allocation into create_crc32()
		* code refactored for traditional_pkware()
		* find_central_directory() is now _really_ efficient

	^ avoid use of own stdint.hpp to use standart stdint.h
	. shared functions:
		+ good number format (123456789 => 123,456,789) for stats()

[ july 05 2011 ]
	. Cracker-ng 0.1a-2 released
	. ZIP module: 
		* code review for create_crc32() and traditional_pkware()
	. shared functions:
		* use of core functions instead of boost::posix_time for stats
		* using one thread for stats()
		+ help(), usage() and version()

[ june 24 2011 ]
	. Cracker-ng 0.1a-1 released
	+ display statistics (pwd/sec) each 5 secondes

		* reduce iterations number by 25% into find_central_directory()
		+ understand the Data Descriptor (local_file_header struct)
		+ support stored file (when compression_method is 0)
		^ string fields were not null terminated
	. shared functions:
		+ current_time() to get current time in microsec
		+ elapsed_seconds() to get elapsed time between two moments

[ june 22 2011 ]
