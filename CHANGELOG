[ dev ]
	. Cracker-ng 2015.mm-jj released

[ february 03 2015 ]
	. Cracker-ng 2015.02-03 released
	. code refactoring
	^ bugs pointed by cppcheck tool
	. ZIP module:
		* use of the patch provided by Mark Adler for the segfault into puff.cc
		* huge optimizations of create_crc32() into crypt.h
		* into puff.*
		* remove define into crypt.h
		. move crc32.h contents to crypt.h and shared/cracker.cc

[ january 21 2013 ]
	. Cracker-ng 2013.01-21 released
	. shared functions:
		^ avoid multiple definition of an option into argz_traitment()
		^ multiple "Invalid read of size 1" for basename()
		* more const, always more const
    	+ add HEX representation of the password
        + substr(), a special to cut too long strings, adding "..." at the beginning or into the middle
        . change the way numbers are printed
		. rename get_filename() to basename()
		. separate Cracker class from main.*
	. CPT module:
		. updated to version 0.1-5
	. ZIP module:
		. updated to version 0.1-1
		* avoid use of boost libraries; speed gain of about 50% for deflated files (use of puff.c from zlib project)
		* decrease iterations number into find_central_directory() [divided by up to 50%]

[ january 07 2013 ]
	. Cracker-ng 2013.01-07 released

		+ -i (--infos) option to get debug informations about a file to crack (only for ZIP)
		. review printed informations and update copyright date
	. CPT module:
		. updated to version 0.1-4
		^ memory leaks into main.cc
		. check crack against new ccrypt version (1.10): ok!
	. ZIP module:
		. updated to version 0.1a-9
		* ability to select the best file to crack (check file size and compression method)
		^ memory leaks into main.cc
		^ segfault with some files, into main.cc
	. shared functions:
		^ memory still reachable into functions.cc
		^ memory leak  for read_stdin() into functions.h
		+ get_filename() to get the file name only (without its directory)
		. change read_stdin to read_input() into functions.h
		. move Stats::format_number() to functions_ng namespace

[ september 14 2012 ]
	. Cracker-ng 2012.09-14 released
	. all modules:
		* each module has its own Makefile and there is a Makefile to build them all
		^ Never use double underscores in C/C++
		+ -f (--file) option to specify which file to crack
		+ -w (--wordlist) option to specify a dictionnaty instead of using stdin
	. CPT module:
		. updated to version 0.1-3
		. is now oriented-object
		. merge ccryptlib.c into ccryptlib.h
		* code refactoring into ccryptlib.h and rijndael.* (speed-up process by 13,5%)
		^ memory leak into main.cc
	. ZIP module:
		. updated to version 0.1a-7
		. is now oriented-object
		. merge crypt.c into crypt.h
		. merge traditional_pkware.* into main.*
		* read.*: create read_ng namespace to reduce code in main.*
		* create_crc32() into crc32.h
		^ warning: narrowing conversion inside { } is ill-formed in C++11
	. shared functions:
		. stats.* are now oriented-object (class Stats)
		. change sleeping_time to 1 sec into stats.cc
		* move total passwords out of statistics struct
		+ functions.h: create the functions_ng namespace
		- cracker-ng.* (few merges with functions.h)

[ july 24 2012 ]
	. Cracker-ng 2012.07-24 released
	. all modules:
		* use of char* instead of std::string (speed up process by 30%)
		* few optimizations
		+ PWD_MAX constant to define the maximum password length (as defined into official sources)
	. CPT module:
		. updated to version 0.1-2
		* functions into ccryptlib.c
	. ZIP module:
		. updated to version 0.1a-6
		* functions into crypt.cpp
		+ print Boost libraries version used with -v (or --version) option

[ february 29 2012 ]
	. Cracker-ng 2012.02-29 released
