Modules to add:
  [ ] rar
  [ ] pdf (could be based on pdfcrack)
  [ ] excel
  [X] ccrypt
  (...)

Ideas:
  [X] find number of files into the ZIP, RAR (or ...) and select the 
      smallest file to test (will have a gain for each operations with a
      little amount of data) [select stored file first].
  [ ] multi threading
  [ ] use internal generator (if you have quite good C or C++ implementation ;))
  [ ] distributed system
  [ ] use GMP
