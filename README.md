What
----

Cracker-ng, a multiple file password finder.
For now, there are these modules:

* zip cracker (zip, winzip, apm, ipa, and all zip based files),
* ccrypt cracker (cpt, antigift) [from the 2nd version (1.1) to the latest (1.10), 1.0 is buggy]

What this tool does **not**:

* call a tierce tool like unrar or unzip to check the password (and will never)
* compute permutations (will change) or create wordlists

What this tool does:

* understand the data format (see src/*)
* check the password using the way official tool does
* use optimized routines
* read passwords from a wordlist or STDIN:
	- cat, john, crunch or whatever you want for wordlist attack


Man
---

Usage: **MODULE**cracker-ng -f FILE

Examples with ZIP module:

* wordlist attack:
	cat wordlist.lst | zipcracker-ng -f FILE  -
	john --incremental --stdout | zipcracker-ng -f FILE -
	crunch 1 8 -f charset.lst lalpha | zipcracker-ng -f FILE -
	zipcracker-ng -f FILE -w wordlist.lst

Why
---

I wrote this tool when I saw poor resources we have on *unix for ZIP and
RAR files password cracking. Hope it will be helpful.
